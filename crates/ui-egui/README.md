# rustmix-ui

Native egui frontend with dockable monitors, inputs, simulated audio and Program overlay editing. See docs/ui-architecture.md. All engine changes use typed commands. File dialogs/IO are off the UI thread. UI-only layout and dialog actions use the coordinator dispatcher.

The opt-in hosted smoke harness exercises native frames, egui input handling, state readback, save/reopen and wgpu screenshots. Run it only on the authorized GitHub build runner. Never use cua-driver for this task.
